# Instructions 
To generate the tidy data set, update the working directory and file paths in the run_analysis.R script and then run the script 
# Tidy Dataset Description
The tidy data set generated by run_analysis.R script is a dataframe of 180 rows and 68 columns. The first column contains the subject/ volunteer identifier number which range from 1-30 and the second column contains the activity the volunteers were performing when the measurements were taken. The next 66 columns contain the average of the mean and standard deviations for each of the activity performed by each volunteer. Descriptive names were given to the activities performed and in instances where the names differ from the names in the raw data, required mapping has been provided in the notes section of this file. No unit have been provided for the values provided in this data set.

# Notes:
Desciptive names assigned to the columns of the tidy data set generated differ in some instances from the raw data set. Please see below the mapping needed in these instances to relate between the contents of these two data sets
